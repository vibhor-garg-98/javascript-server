# MERN-STACK
MERN stack is a web development framework. It consists of MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS as its working components. Here are the details of what each of these components is used for in developing a web application when using MERN stack:

  **MongoDB** : A document-oriented, No-SQL database used to store the application data.A document is a set of key-value pairs defined by a schema which defines how the data is structured and organized in a database. A group of documents makes up a collection, and documents within the same collection can have different schema. This is referred to as dynamic schema.MongoDB, a distributed database at its core, is known to provide high performance, scalability, and flexibility in querying and indexing data. It is easy to integrate with applications as the document model can map to objects in the code. It provides drivers for major languages and there is also a lot of professional support available.Some of the prominent users of MongoDB are Google, Facebook, Lyft, Adobe, etc.

  **NodeJS**: Node.js provides a JavaScript Environment which allows the user to run their code on the server (outside the browser). Node pack manager i.e. npm allows the user to choose from thousands of free packages (node modules) to download.
  - Open source JavaScript Runtime Environemnt
  - Single threading – Follows a single threaded model.
  - Data Streaming
  - Fast – Built on Google Chrome’s JavaScript Engine, Node.js has a fast code execution.
  - Highly Scalable
  - Initialize a Node.js application by typing runing the below command in the command window. 
  - Create a file named index.js.

  **ExpressJS**: A framework layered on top of NodeJS, used to build the backend of a site using NodeJS functions and structures. Since NodeJS was not developed to make websites but rather run JavaScript on a machine, ExpressJS was developed.Express supports many middlewares which makes the code shorter and easier to write.
  - Asynchronous and Single-threaded.
  - Effecient, fast & scalable
  - Has the biggest community for Node.js
  - Express promotes code reusability with its built-in router.
  - Robust API

  **ReactJS**: React is a JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces. React is used for the development of single-page applications and mobile applications because of its ability to handle rapidly changing data. React allows users to code in JavasScript and create UI components.A library created by Facebook. It is used to build UI components that create the user interface of the single page web application.
   - Virtual DOM 
   - JSX (JavaScript XML)
   - Components
   - High Performance 
   - Developing Android/Ios Apps
