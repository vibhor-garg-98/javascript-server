                                  features of VS CODE


1. Intellisense
IntelliSense is code auto-complete meets artificial intelligence. This utility provides a list of suggestions along with a short hint or description as we are writing codes. These is derived from several contextual factors such as the programming language, the syntax, the variables, the functions as well as all the codes within the file.

2. Peek
While coding, you may often forget a particular function, where the function is initially defined, and what are the required parameters.

3. CLI
Similar to SublimeText with its subl command line, Visual Studio Code is equipped a CLI named code and it is easy to install.

4. Built-in Git
Visual Studio Code has Git built right in the editor. On the left of the sidebar, you will find the Git icon where you can initialize Git as well as perform several Git commands such as commit, pull, push, rebase, publish, and look into the changes within the file.

5. Task Runner
Last but not least, Visual Studio Code also has a built-in Task Runner, which provides some level of convenience.

To use this feature, we can either set a tasks.json file or through some popular Task configuration like Grunt, Gulp, or MSBuild if provided. Once the configuration is set, we can run the Task Runner through the Command Palette by typing Run Task. Typing Tasks will list all related commands.
